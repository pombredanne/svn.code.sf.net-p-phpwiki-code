== Title Search ==

Here's a title search. Try something like ##wiki or sandwich##.

<<WikiFormRich action=TitleSearch method=GET nobr=1 class=wikiaction
  editbox[] name=s text=""
  submit[]
  checkbox[] name=case_exact
  pulldown[] name=regex value="auto,none,glob,posix,pcre,sql">>

== Full Text Search ==

Use the following for a full text search. This takes a few seconds.
The results will show all lines on a given page which contain a
match.

<<WikiFormRich action=FullTextSearch method=GET nobr=1 class=wikiaction
  editbox[] name=s text=""
  submit[]
  checkbox[] name=case_exact
  pulldown[] name=regex value="auto,none,glob,posix,pcre,sql">>

== Fuzzy Search ==

In a fuzzy pages search the titles of all pages are examined to find
those which are similarly spelled or similar sounding (English).

<?plugin-form FuzzyPages ?>

== Tips ==

* Separate words with a space. All words have to match as exact strings.

  <verbatim>
  Example: search for “databas” will NOT match the text “PGSQL database is a nice product.”
  </verbatim>
* Search for consecutive words by using quotes.

  <verbatim>
  Example: ‘white dog’ will match “This is a white dog.”
  </verbatim>
* Search for some special chars, such as @ ! &, in the keyword is allowed. Yet you can NOT search for such chars only.

  <verbatim>
  Example: ‘year!’ will match “Happy new year!”.
  </verbatim>

  <verbatim>
  Example: search for '!!!' will NOT return any result.
  </verbatim>
* Search for Chinese words is allowed.
* You can search titles in “Title Search” section, and search wiki contents in “Full Text Search” section.
