REQUIREMENTS

PhpWiki requires PHP version 4.0.? or greater. 

Since version 1.3.0 of PhpWiki we have been using the DB.php from PEAR
(a database absraction layer), so you need that installed/enabled
too. See http://pear.php.net/ for more information.

(note about
 // You shouldn't have to change this unless you see a WikiFatalError:
//   lib/FileFinder.php:82: Fatal[256]: DB.php: file not found
//
#ini_set('include_path', '.:/where/you/installed/phpwiki');
goes here)

You need the Perl regular expressions package compiled in; this is the
default for PHP, so you probably have it. (If you don't you'll see an
error like "function preg_replace() not defined.")

Below are the instructions for the "out of the box" installation,
which uses DB files. If you are using a relational database like
MySQL, see the INSTALL file for your database in the doc/ directory
under the root of your PhpWiki installation.



0. INSTALLATION

Untar/gzip this file into the directory where you want it to live.
That's it.

bash$ gzip -d phpwiki-X.XX.tar.gz
bash$ tar -xvf phpwiki-X.XX.tar

Look at index.php and edit the settings there to your liking.


1. CONFIGURATION

The first time you run this Wiki it will load a set of basic pages from
the pgsrc/ directory. These should be enough to get your Wiki started.

PhpWiki will create some DBM files in /tmp. They contain the pages of the
live site, archived pages, and some additional information.

If you don't want the DBM files to live in /tmp you must make sure the web
server can read/write to your chosen location.  It's probably a bad idea
to leave it in /tmp. (Again, edit index.php). 

(WARNING: on many systems, files in /tmp are subject to periodic
removal. We very strongly advise you to move the files to another
directory.)

For example, you create a subdirectory called "pages" in the wiki
directory made when you untarred PhpWiki. Move the DBM files there.
The files should already have proper rights and owners, as they were
created by the web server. Otherwise change them accordingly so your
web server can read/write the DBM files. (Note you must be root to
move files created by the web server).

Then you must ensure that the web server can access the "pages" directory
and can create new files in it. These can be achieved e.g. by doing

bash$ chown nobody:youraccount pages
bash$ chmod 755 pages

if your web server runs as user 'nobody'. This is necessary so that
the server can also create/set the lock file (PHP has a built in
locking mechanism for DBM file access).  Or if you're really lazy and
don't worry much about security:

bash$ chmod 777 pages

Note: this is insecure. The proper way is to let the directory be owned
by the web servers GUID and give it read and write access.



2. ALLOWING EMBEDDED HTML

(This is not working in the 1.3 branch as of this writing.)
PhpWiki ships with this featured disabled by default. According to CERT 
(http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html) malicious users can embed
HTML in your pages that allow pure evil to happen. You can uncomment the 
"elseif" in lib/transform.php to allow embedded HTML; but you should NEVER
do this if your Wiki is publically accessible.


3. ETC

Installing PHP is beyond the scope of this document :-)
You should visit http://www.php.net/ if you don't have PHP.
Note that you should have the web server configured to allow index.php
as the root document of a directory.
