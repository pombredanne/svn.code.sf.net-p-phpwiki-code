To add a new page to Wiki, all you have to do is come up with a
meaningful title, capitalize all the words and
StringThemTogetherLikeThis. Wiki automagically recognizes it as a
hyperlink. Alternatively, you can put anything into ~[brackets~].

Then you can go ahead and ClickTheQuestionMark at the end of your new
hyperlink, and the Wiki will give you a window for making the new
page.

If you wish to add documents with complex markup to the Wiki, you
might be better off providing a URL to it than trying to add the text
of the document here, like so:

PhpWiki project homepage: http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/

The Wiki does not support most HTML tags, only the simpliest. See Help:TextFormattingRules.
<tags>They will just render like text.</tags> Wiki is meant to be as
simple as possible to encourage use.

Note that there is a feature that your system administrator can enable
to allow embedded HTML, but there are security risks involved.
