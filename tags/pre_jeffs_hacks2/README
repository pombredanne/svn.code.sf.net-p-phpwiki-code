The out-of-the-box version uses a dbm file in the /tmp directory; you may
wish a more permanent place for yours, but make sure it's read/writable
by your web server!

NOTE: Not all database versions are equal. The MySQL and Postgresql
implementations have the full set of features; DBM and mSQL are
missing only a few, and the flat file implementation is solid
and waiting for your improvement. All are suitable for production.
