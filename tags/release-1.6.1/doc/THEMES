== Brief Example of Creating Your Own WikiTheme ==

To create or modify one of the existing themes:
* Make a copy of one of the themes.
* Look through the default theme, and for any of those templates you
  want to modify, duplicate them in your new theme folder with the
  same directory structure and modify them there instead of the
  originals.
* Fix the name in ##themeinfo.php##:
  {{{
  $WikiTheme = new WikiTheme('NewName');
  }}}
* or if you have to override some default ~WikiTheme methods
  {{{
  class WikiTheme_NewName extends WikiTheme;
  ...
  $WikiTheme = new WikiTheme_NewName('NewName');
  }}}

Note: \\
If you base your theme on the default theme instead of one of the
others, you can safely delete any files you DID NOT modify from the
original (so long as you keep the default theme!).

Review the ##themeinfo.php## for any necessary changes, and add the name
of your theme to ##index.php##.
  {{{
  define('THEME','NewName');
  }}}

== Template Structure ==

Templates must use the ##.tmpl## extension (simple PHP parsed files).

Only one template is called, usually the ##html.tmpl## template,
which includes all other templates then.

~WikiTheme templates are regular HTML, but the PHP parts within "<?php" and "?>"
are treated especially by ~PhpWiki. HTML entities within the PHP parts
should be created by our ~HtmlElement methods, which create well-formed
HTML objects.
Pure HTML entities, e.g. {{{<?php echo "<br>" ?>}}} will be escaped to ##&lt;br&gt;##.

You can easily embed other templates by your own, e.g. ##<?php echo Template('body') ?>##

Templates are used
* by the master action (html and htmldump), which include most other
  plugins in a hierarchical manner,
* by certain actions (editpage) or plugins (e.g. info, userprefs,
  addcomment, ...) or
* by certain pagetypes (e.g. wikiblog, comment, wikiforum)

To include templates from other themes use this syntax:
  {{{
  <?php echo Template('default/search') ?>
  }}}
includes the search template from the default theme.

Warning!
When you write your own templates or change existing ones, you might
easily destroy HTML validity of the generated pages. By using
the various HTML() methods within a plugin's PHP code it is guaranteed
to produce validating HTML, by using custom templates not.

== Theme switching ==

If you change the theme in your user preferences, you might need to run an upgrade to create the pages that are needed by the theme. For example, the wikilens theme needs the page ##LeftbarContent## (located in ##themes/wikilens/pgsrc/LeftbarContent##). Same for blog theme that needs ##About##, ##Blog##, ##CategoryHowTo##, ##HowTo## and ##PhotoAlbum##.
