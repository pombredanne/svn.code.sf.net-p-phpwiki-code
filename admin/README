!!! Open Office 2.3 (or above) and Star Office to Phpwiki converter

* Start Open Office 2.3 (or above)
* From Tool choose "XML Filter Settings"
* Choose "New" and in "General" fill the form with the following data:

* Choose Transformation and fill the form with the following data:
** XSLT for Export: put the full path to <strong>odt2phpwiki.xsl</strong>

!! Use

Open your Word document in Open Office 2.3.

Select ''Export...'' in the ''File'' menu, then select ''Phpwiki'' in ''File format'' menu.

You will get a text file (.txt). Copy and paste the content of this file in your wiki page.

Everything should work, except:
* centered text and right-aligned text (will be left-aligned),
* the wiki only supports 3 levels of titles,
* tables will always be bordered (class="bordered"), regardless they are or not in Word; you might want to change this in the generated content,
* some <nowiki> and </nowiki> tags might remain in the code.

If there was a table of contents in your Word file, you can delete it and replace it with the ~CreateToc plugin (use the TOC button from the Edit Toolbar).

You should also upload the images in your document.
