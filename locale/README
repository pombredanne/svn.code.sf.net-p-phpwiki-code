Phpwiki can be localized and use different languages.

If you would like to use one of supported languages, then
just go to lib/config.php and set the language to use there.

This README describes how to add support for a new language.


Let's assume you would like to support Islandic (code 'is').

Just copy locale/po/phpwiki.pot to locale/po/is.po.
Then, translate all the strings inside is.po to Islandic.
See the other *.po files as example if you are uncertain about the
syntax. Hint: Emacs has a handy po translation mode for you.


Most of the work, though, is in translating the pgsrc and template
files.  Do the following:

    mkdir locale/is
    cp -rv pgsrc locale/is
    cp -rv templates locale/is

Note: it is more important to translate the templates than to translate
the pgsrc/ files. For the pgsrc/ files it is sufficient to change their
names to Islandic and maybe translate the FrontPage (or how it is
called in Islandic). Again, for anything you don't know, look at the
`nl' or `de' versions.


After you have finished translating, you may want to check the result
of your efforts.

First you need to modify locale/translate.sh
Add Islandic to the variable ALL_LINGUAS like this:
	ALL_LINGUAS="nl es de is"

Then (from the main directory where index.php resides) run:

    ./locale/translate.sh

which generates all necessary files**.
If this step fails, because you don't have the necessary software
installed, then just send your files to one of the phpwiki developers
and we run translate.sh for you.


Next edit ./lib/config.php and change the line that sets $LANG to
make phpwiki use your language, e.g.  make them look like this:

   //  Select your language - default language "C": English
   // other languages available: Dutch "nl", Spanish "es", German "de"
   // $LANG="C";
   $LANG="is";

Phpwiki should now speak Islandic.


If you're unfamiliar with GNU gettext and po files, you may find some
information at http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/

If you succeed, you may also want to add instructions to this
translation README for phpwiki ;-)

Good luck,

**)translate.sh is a simple script that tries to replace the usual
   `make po po-update'.  It actually does these things:

   * make the .pot file up to date
   * merge differences into all translated .po files
   * generate .mo files
   * generate legacy php3 translation dictionary [this is the hairiest
     part and should be dropped when we drop php3 support]
