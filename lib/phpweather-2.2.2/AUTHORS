Kristian Kristensen (kkrz)
     He made the interface to PostgreSQL.

Jeremy D. Zawodny
     He wrote `Geo::METAR', which is a Perl module which can do some of
     the things PHP Weather now does. `Geo::METAR' can be found here:
     `http://www.wcnet.org/jzawodn/perl/Geo-METAR/index.html'.

Enrico Lodolo
     For suggesting that I use http to get the METARs instead of the
     much slower ftp.

Stefan Wiesendanger
     For rewritting some large `case'- and `switch'-statements as a
     couple of arrays. This speeds-up the parsing of the METARs.

Mike
     He noticed that the pressures was all wrong. I though the unit
     used in the METAR was hPa, when it really was inHg.

Jeffrey Y. Sue
     Suggested that I told people how to turn off the warnings, if you
     don't establish a connection to MySQL.

     Later he made it possible to use PHP Weather with DBM databases. He
     also added support for precipitation. Lots of other stuff, see the
     `ChangeLog' for more details.

Rutger Lubbers
     Noticed that South/southeast was duplicated in the
     directions-array.

Eduardo Guilenea
     Translated PHP Weather into Spanish, and thereby forced me to add
     support for multiply languages. (Which was a Good Thing :-)

Sven-Erik (seasoft)
     Translated PHP Weather into Norwegian.

     He also sat down and did the boring work, when he manually compiled
     the complete list of all airports available from NWS.

Maciek Uhlig
     Noticed that I sometimes tried to access `$cloud_coverage_array'
     with just `$cloud_coverage' -- which, of cause, didn't work.

Ing. Vladimir Kotala
     Suggested that I changed the long text `... degrees Celsius' into
     the more compact `... °C', which is much better.

Gyulai Mihály (misibacsi) `http://gyulai.freeyellow.com/'
     Made the Hungarian translation for PHP Weather. He has also
     corrected tons of spelling errors.

Johnny Funder <jhf@naviair.dk>
     Lots of explanations and suggestions. He also gave a much simpler
     formula for calculating the relative humidity.

Ray van Beek
     Helped me spot a little error with the current weather. He has also
     written code that displays the current weather as an image.

David Kjellquist
     Added support for windchill.

Max Hammond (iridium)
     Lots of different things: bugfixes, clever suggestions, and general
     maintenance.

Jesús Peñas
     Made the Spanish translation.

Ondrej Jombik (nepto)
     Translated PHP Weather into Slovak and rewrote the navigation
     system used in index.php. He also looked at the MySQL and
     PostgreSQL database and found some security flaws.

Reini Urban
     Fixed some problems with using PHP Weather on a default
     installation of PHP 4.2.

Kari Salovaara and Tage Malmen
     Translated PHP Weater into Swedish and Finnish.

Paul Kairis
     Wrote the code that handles connections through a proxy server.

Bas Elshof
     Translated PHP Weather into Dutch.

Václav Ríkal
     Made a Czech translation.

Radoslava Fedáková
     Czech translation.

Guillaume Petit
     Translated PHP Weather into French.

Rudy Boedts
     Updated the Dutch translation.

Konrad Tadesse
     Finally, a working German translation.

Andrew Simpson (andrewsimpson)
     Reported problems with the use of short open tags in a couple of
     files.

Jim Whitehead
     Fixed the rounding of hours and minutes in the pretty-printed
     report.

Ferhat Bingol
     Made a Turkish translation.

Renato Gallmetzer
     Provided us with an Italian translation.

Pablo Alcaraz (pabloa)
     Updated the Spanish translation and other bugfixes.

Etienne Tourigny (etienne_t)
     Added a method that decodes TAF reports and made some of the
     database backends archive the data instead of always replacing the
     old data with new reports.

Justin Heideman
     Drew a full set of beautiful icons for PHP Weather to display the
     current weather conditions.

Warren Rohner
     Updated the South African stations in the `stations.csv' file.

Nick Crossland (ncrossland)
     Made a British English translation.

José de Ávila Junior
     Updated the Brazillian stations in the `stations.csv' file.

Cláudio Gamboa
     Contributed a Portugues translation.
