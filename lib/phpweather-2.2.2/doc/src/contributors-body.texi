@item Kristian Kristensen (kkrz)

He made the interface to PostgreSQL.

@item Jeremy D. Zawodny

He wrote @code{Geo::METAR}, which is a Perl module which can do some
of the things PHP Weather now does. @code{Geo::METAR} can be found
here: @uref{http://www.wcnet.org/jzawodn/perl/Geo-METAR/index.html}.

@item Enrico Lodolo

For suggesting that I use http to get the METARs instead of the much
slower ftp.

@item Stefan Wiesendanger

For rewritting some large @code{case}- and @code{switch}-statements as
a couple of arrays. This speeds-up the parsing of the METARs.

@item Mike

He noticed that the pressures was all wrong. I though the unit used in
the METAR was hPa, when it really was inHg.

@item Jeffrey Y. Sue

Suggested that I told people how to turn off the warnings, if you
don't establish a connection to MySQL.

Later he made it possible to use PHP Weather with DBM databases. He
also added support for precipitation. Lots of other stuff, see the
@file{ChangeLog} for more details.

@item Rutger Lubbers

Noticed that South/southeast was duplicated in the directions-array.

@item Eduardo Guilenea

Translated PHP Weather into Spanish, and thereby forced me to add
support for multiply languages. (Which was a Good Thing :-)

@item Sven-Erik (seasoft)

Translated PHP Weather into Norwegian.

He also sat down and did the boring work, when he manually compiled
the complete list of all airports available from NWS.

@item Maciek Uhlig

Noticed that I sometimes tried to access @code{$cloud_coverage_array}
with just @code{$cloud_coverage} --- which, of cause, didn't work.

@item Ing. Vladimir Kotala

Suggested that I changed the long text @samp{@dots{} degrees Celsius}
into the more compact @samp{@dots{} °C}, which is much
better.

@item Gyulai Mih@'aly (misibacsi) @uref{http://gyulai.freeyellow.com/}

Made the Hungarian translation for PHP Weather. He has also corrected
tons of spelling errors.

@item Johnny Funder @email{jhf@@naviair.dk}

Lots of explanations and suggestions. He also gave a much simpler
formula for calculating the relative humidity.

@item Ray van Beek

Helped me spot a little error with the current weather. He has also
written code that displays the current weather as an image.

@item David Kjellquist

Added support for windchill.

@item Max Hammond (iridium)

Lots of different things: bugfixes, clever suggestions, and general
maintenance.

@item Jes@'us Pe@~nas
      
Made the Spanish translation.

@item Ondrej Jombik (nepto)

Translated PHP Weather into Slovak and rewrote the navigation system
used in index.php. He also looked at the MySQL and PostgreSQL database
and found some security flaws.

@item Reini Urban

Fixed some problems with using PHP Weather on a default installation
of PHP 4.2.

@item Kari Salovaara and Tage Malmen

Translated PHP Weater into Swedish and Finnish.

@item Paul Kairis

Wrote the code that handles connections through a proxy server.

@item Bas Elshof

Translated PHP Weather into Dutch.

@item V@'aclav R@'{@dotless{i}}kal

Made a Czech translation.

@item Radoslava Fed@'akov@'a

Czech translation.

@item Guillaume Petit

Translated PHP Weather into French.

@item Rudy Boedts

Updated the Dutch translation.

@item Konrad Tadesse

Finally, a working German translation.

@item Andrew Simpson (andrewsimpson)

Reported problems with the use of short open tags in a couple of
files.

@item Jim Whitehead

Fixed the rounding of hours and minutes in the pretty-printed report.

@item Ferhat Bingol

Made a Turkish translation.

@item Renato Gallmetzer

Provided us with an Italian translation.

@item Pablo Alcaraz (pabloa)

Updated the Spanish translation and other bugfixes.

@item Etienne Tourigny (etienne_t)

Added a method that decodes TAF reports and made some of the database
backends archive the data instead of always replacing the old data
with new reports.

@item Justin Heideman

Drew a full set of beautiful icons for PHP Weather to display the
current weather conditions.

@item Warren Rohner

Updated the South African stations in the @file{stations.csv} file.

@item Nick Crossland (ncrossland)

Made a British English translation.

@item Jos@'e de @'Avila Junior

Updated the Brazillian stations in the @file{stations.csv} file.
