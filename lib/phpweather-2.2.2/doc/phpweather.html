<H1>PHP Weather User and Reference Guide</H1>

<P>

This is the definitive guide to PHP Weather, or at least it tries to
be. PHP Weather is a script written in <A HREF="http://www.php.net/">PHP</A>
which makes it possible to display the current weather on a
webpage. The system is based on data from 4,500 airports scattered all
over the world, so there is a good chance that you will find a station
near your place.

<H1> Introduction </H1>
<!--docid::SEC1::-->
<P>

PHP Weather is script written in <A HREF="http://www.php.net/">PHP</A> that
can decode a METAR. A <EM>METAR</EM><A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="phpweather.html#FOOT1">(1)</A> is a weather report used for
avionic purposes -- it has information about the temperature, the
wind speed and direction, the clouds, the current weather phenomena,
and so on. The information is presented in a special coded format, a
format which PHP Weather can decode.
</P>
<P>

The METAR reports are made at about 4,500 airports from around the
world, so there is a good chance that you live near one of them. And
the airports make an report once or twice an hour, so you will be able
to provide fresh reports on your website.
</P>
<P>

The reports from all over the world are stored at the National Weather
Service (the <EM>NWS</EM>, see <A HREF="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/">http://www.nws.noaa.gov/</A>) which is
a department under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(<EM>NOAA</EM>, see <A HREF="http://www.noaa.gov/">http://www.noaa.gov/</A>) of the United States.
The reports are available using both HTTP and FTP -- PHP Weather uses
HTTP because it is the fastest of the two protocols.
</P>
<P>

Once you have got hold of a METAR, you will want to display the
weather report contained within it. A textual display, known as a
<EM>pretty print</EM> looks like this:
	
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

This is a report for <EM>Aalborg, Denmark</EM>. The report was made
<EM>33</EM> minutes ago, at <EM>21:50</EM> UTC. The wind was blowing at a
speed of <EM>2.1</EM> meters per second (<EM>4.6</EM> miles per hour) from
<EM>east</EM> (<EM>100°</EM>). The temperature was <EM>16</EM>°C (<EM>61</EM>
°F), with a dew-point at <EM>15</EM> °C (<EM>59</EM> °F). The atmospheric
pressure was <EM>1017</EM> hPa (<EM>30.03</EM> inHg). The relative
humidity was <EM>93.8%</EM>. There were no clouds below <EM>1524</EM>
meter (<EM>5000</EM> feet) and no cumulonimbus clouds. The overall
visibility was greater than <EM>10</EM> kilometers (<EM>6.2</EM> miles).
</P>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Each station is uniquely identified by it is <EM>ICAO</EM> code. ICAO is
an abbreviation for the <A HREF="http://www.icao.org/">International
Civil Aviation Organization</A>.
</P>
<P>

You can control the output in various ways:
</P>
<P>

<UL>

<LI>
You can change the HTML markup that is inserted before and
after each value in the report. Using `<SAMP>&lt;b&gt;</SAMP>' and `<SAMP>&lt;/b&gt;</SAMP>' gives
you <B>bold letters</B> whereas `<SAMP>&lt;font color=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;</SAMP>' and
`<SAMP>&lt;/font&gt;</SAMP>' gives you navy-blue colored text. The choice is yours,
see <A HREF="phpweather.html#SEC10">3.1.1 Changing the Output</A>.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
You can change the language of the report. The report is built by
combining many tiny strings which can be translated into other
languages. There is also support for more diverse translations, see
<A HREF="phpweather.html#SEC13">4.1 Diverse Translations</A>.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

Instead of text, you can also have PHP Weather select icons for you
that match the current weather conditions.

<!--docid::SEC3::-->
<P>

The first thing to do, is to get hold of PHP Weather. The official PHP
Weather homepage can be reached at <A HREF="http://phpweather.net/">http://phpweather.net/</A> and
you will be able to download the latest version of PHP Weather from the
&quot;Downloads&quot; section.
</P>
<P>

After you have downloaded PHP Weather in your favorite format (we
provide files in three formats: `<TT>tar.gz</TT>', `<TT>tar.bz2</TT>', and
`<TT>zip</TT>') you should unpack it in a temporary place. If the file you
downloaded is called `<TT>phpweather-x.y.tar.gz</TT>', then it will be
unpacked in a directory called `<TT>phpweather-x.y</TT>'. Upload this
directory with all its files to your webserver.
</P>
<P>

PHP Weather has now been installed! Use your browser to load the file
`<TT>index.php</TT>' found in the root-directory of the PHP Weather
installation and see how it works. You will be presented with a
demonstration of PHP Weather.

<H2> 2.1 The `<TT>defaults.php</TT>' file </H2>
<!--docid::SEC5::-->
<P>

The behaviour of PHP Weather is controlled by several things. All
options have default values, but they can be changed in several
places. The value of an option is found by this process:
</P>
<P>

<OL>

<LI>
The file `<TT>defaults-dist.php</TT>' in the root-directory of the
PHP Weather installation is read using <CODE>include</CODE>. This defines
the initial values of the options.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Next, the file `<TT>defaults.php</TT>' is read if it exists. This file
is not part of the PHP Weather distribution, but should be created by
you if you want to change some of the defaults from
`<TT>defaults-dist.php</TT>'.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
You can supply an array when you create an object from the PHP Weather
codebase. The following code will create a <CODE>phpweather</CODE> object
with the ICAO set to `<SAMP>EKAH</SAMP>':
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>$weather = new phpweather(array('icao' =&gt; 'EKAH'));
</pre></td></tr></table><P>

You can (of course) change several options at the same time, the
general template for this is
</P>
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>$weather = new phpweather(array('<VAR>option-1</VAR>' =&gt; `<SAMP>value-1</SAMP>',
                                '<VAR>option-2</VAR>' =&gt; `<SAMP>value-2</SAMP>',
                                <small>...</small>,
                                '<VAR>option-n</VAR>' =&gt; `<SAMP>value-n</SAMP>'));
</pre></td></tr></table><P>

</P>
<LI>
You can change some of the options after you have created the
object. If you want to change the current ICAO of a <CODE>phpweather</CODE>
object, then you will use the <CODE>set_icao</CODE> method like this:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>$weather-&gt;set_icao('EKYT');
</pre></td></tr></table><P>

</OL>
<P>

The idea is, that you should create a `<TT>defaults.php</TT>' file with
the options that you will always want to use -- things like database
and proxy settings. To create the file, you should use the supplied
script `<TT>make_config.php</TT>' found in the `<TT>config</TT>' directory.
</P>
<P>

Load the script in the browser and follow the instructions. In short,
then you build the configuration file by repeatedly choosing/changing
options until the all say &quot;Input accepted&quot;. You will notice that all
options are at their default settings when you load the page initially
--- you will have to change something and press the &quot;Update Options&quot;
button before anything changes.
</P>
<P>

When you press the button, the page will reload, and the configuration
file found at the bottom is updated with your new selections. Also,
your selection might give your more choices such as when you change
the <CODE>use_proxy</CODE> option from &quot;No&quot; to &quot;Yes&quot;. When you press the
update button you will be presented with input fields for the
<CODE>proxy_host</CODE> and the <CODE>proxy_port</CODE>. Because we cannot
anticipate the name of your proxy, the <CODE>proxy_host</CODE> will be set
to nothing (the empty string &quot;&quot;) initially. Since this is not a
valid hostname, you will see a text in red that says exactly this.
</P>
<P>

Continue to make changes to the options. When you are happy with the
configuration you should press the &quot;Download the Configuration&quot;
button. Your browser should ask you where to same the downloaded file
--- save it as `<TT>defaults.php</TT>' in the root of your PHP Weather
installation.
</P>
<P>

All new objects created will now start out with the options in this
file. This means that you can store sensitive things like database
passwords in just one location, instead of having it scattered through
out all the scripts that use PHP Weather. Just remember to protect the
`<TT>defaults.php</TT>' file itself if you put your password in it!

<H2> 2.2 Choosing a Database Backend </H2>
<!--docid::SEC6::-->
<P>

PHP Weather works by retrieving weather reports called METARs. It
takes some time to get the METARs, so you will be interested in using
a local database as a cache. All database backends support the same
features (see <A HREF="phpweather.html#SEC7">2.3 Required Functions in a Backend</A> for details) but
differ in speed. Your version of PHP might also lack support for some
of the backends. PHP Weather supports the following databases
backends:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>null</CODE>
<DD>This is the default &quot;database&quot; backend, but it is not really a
database. It pretends to cache the METARs, but in reallity it just
throws them away. This means that PHP Weather will have to fetch them
from the NWS again each time.
<P>

This makes the <CODE>null</CODE> backend the slowest backend if you
repeadaly need the same METAR, e.g. if you show the current weather
for a fixed location on your homepage. But it is just as quick (or
slow, depending on how you view things) as the other backends when it
comes to showing the weather for a random station. So if that is your
typical usage-pattern, then you might like this backend.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>pw_mysql</CODE>
<DD>You can use the <A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</A> relational
database with PHP Weather.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>pw_pgsql</CODE>
<DD>You can also choose to use a <A HREF="http://postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</A>
database.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>pw_dba</CODE>
<DD>This database backend uses normal files on the webserver to do the
caching. You will have to ensure that the PHP process on the webserver
can write to the `<TT>db/files</TT>' directory so that the necessary files
can be created and maintained.
<P>

</DL>
<P>

After you have chosen a database backend, you will have to initialize
the database. You should first generate the appropriate
`<TT>defaults.php</TT>' file, see <A HREF="phpweather.html#SEC5">2.1 The `<TT>defaults.php</TT>' file</A>.
</P>
<P>

After you have uploaded the file to the webserver, you can load the
script `<TT>make_db.php</TT>' found in the `<TT>config</TT>' directory in your
favorite browser. When you press the &quot;Create or Recreate Tables&quot;
button the database will be initialized.  If you have selected a
SQL-based database, then the necessary tables will be created.
</P>
<P>

If you have selected a file-based database, then the script will attempt
to create the necessary files. This might very well fail: the script
is run by the webserver, and the webserver will most likely <EM>not</EM>
have permission to create new files in the `<TT>db/files</TT>' directory
under the PHP Weather root directory because the webserver runs as an
unprivileged user.
</P>
<P>

So, you will have to change the permission on the `<TT>db/files</TT>'
directory.  Assuming that the webserver is running some form of Unix
and that you have shell access to the machine, then you can execute
the following commands after you have logged into the webserver.  If
you do not have that kind of access to the machine, then you should
still be able to change the permissions using your FTP program.  The
relevant commands are:
</P>
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>cd /root/directory/of/phpweather/installation
chmod 777 db/files
chmod 777 db/files/*
</pre></td></tr></table><P>

Everybody will now be allowed to create and change files under the
`<TT>db/files</TT>' directory. <STRONG>This is a security risk!</STRONG> If you
know of a better way to allow the webserver read/write access to the
files, please use that instead and tell us so that we can update the
manual.

<H2> 2.3 Required Functions in a Backend </H2>
<!--docid::SEC7::-->
<P>

All database backends have to support a common set of methods -- if
PHP had support for <EM>interfaces</EM>, then we would require them to
implement a database interface.  Because of the lack of interfaces in
the PHP language we are left with this description of what a database
backend has to satisfy.
</P>
<P>

All database backends are defined in their own class which is a
subclass of the <CODE>pw_db_common</CODE> class. If we pretend that we have
a <CODE>pw_db_foo</CODE> database backend, then it must implement
the following methods:
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
</P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Method:</U> pw_db_foo <B>get_type</B>
<DD>This should return the type of the backend, `<SAMP>foo</SAMP>' in our case.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
</P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Method:</U> pw_db_foo <B>connect</B>
<DD>This is called by every other method that wants to ensure that the
database is up and running. The method should cache the result of this
operation as it will be called several times.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
</P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Method:</U> pw_db_foo <B>disconnect</B>
<DD>This disconnects from the database.

<H2> 3.2 The Raw Data </H2>
<!--docid::SEC11::-->
<P>

It is easy for you to get hold of the raw data produced by the code in
`<TT>phpweather.php</TT>':
</P>
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>$weather = new phpweather();
$data = $weather-&gt;decode_metar();
</pre></td></tr></table><P>

The variable <CODE>$data</CODE> is now an multidimensional associative array
filled with all the information that the <CODE>decode_metar</CODE> function
was able to extract from the METAR. The different parts in the METAR
is stored under specific keys in the array -- if the METAR lacks a
given part, then the corresponding entry in the array will be left
out.  This means that you will have to check each entry with the
built-in PHP function <CODE>empty</CODE> before you use it, otherwise you
see warnings from PHP, if you have set the error reporting level high
enough.
</P>
<P>

You can have PHP show you the structure of the array by using the
builtin <CODE>print_r</CODE> function like this:
</P>
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>echo &quot;&lt;pre&gt;\n&quot;;
print_r($data);
echo &quot;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&quot;;
</pre></td></tr></table><P>

The following entries is always part of a METAR report, and
is therefore always part of the decoded METAR array:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>type</CODE>
<DD>This can either be `<SAMP>METAR</SAMP>' or `<SAMP>SPECI</SAMP>' and denotes the type
of the report.  This is not used for anything.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>metar</CODE>
<DD>The raw METAR report.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>icao</CODE>
<DD>The ICAO of the station which made the report.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>location</CODE>
<DD>The English name of the station.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>time</CODE>
<DD>A UNIX timestamp corresponding to the time of the report.
<P>

</DL>
<P>

The following entries are all optional so check with <CODE>empty</CODE>
before accessing them:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>report_mod</CODE>
<DD>A report modifier which gives information about how the report was
made: `<SAMP>AUTO</SAMP>' for a fully automated report with no human
intervention or `<SAMP>COR</SAMP>' for a corrected report. It is supposed to
be part of all METARs, but experience shows that it is not.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>wind</CODE>
<DD>This is an array with information about the wind. The <CODE>deg</CODE> entry
tells you the direction of the wind as compass-direction. If the wind
came from variable directions, then will be the string `<SAMP>VRB</SAMP>'.
<P>

The <CODE>meters_per_second</CODE>, <CODE>miles_per_hour</CODE>, and <CODE>knots</CODE>
entries tells you the wind speed in various units.
</P>
<P>

If gust was observed, there will be three extra entries:
<CODE>gust_meters_per_second</CODE>, <CODE>gust_miles_per_hour</CODE>, and
<CODE>gust_knots</CODE>.
</P>
<P>

If the wind was varying, then two extra entries are present:
<CODE>var_beg</CODE> and <CODE>var_end</CODE>. Both of these entries contain a
compass-direction
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>visibility</CODE>
<DD>This is an array with visibility information. Each entry in the array
is a separate visibility group.
<P>

Each visibility group contains a <CODE>prefix</CODE> which can be `<SAMP>-1</SAMP>',
`<SAMP>0</SAMP>', or `<SAMP>1</SAMP>' which tells you if the visibility reported is
&quot;less than&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;, or &quot;greater than&quot; respectively.
</P>
<P>

The visibility itself is stored in the <CODE>meter</CODE>, <CODE>km</CODE>,
<CODE>ft</CODE>, and <CODE>miles</CODE> entries. There is an optional entry
<CODE>dir</CODE> for a direction -- if there is no direction, then the
visibility refers to the overall visibility.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>runway</CODE>
<DD>This is an array of runway groups. Each entry is a separate group.
<P>

The groups contain an <CODE>nr</CODE> entry and an optional <CODE>approach</CODE>
entry which tells you the runway-number and the approach respectively.
The approach is one of `<SAMP>L</SAMP>', `<SAMP>C</SAMP>', or `<SAMP>R</SAMP>' for &quot;left&quot;,
&quot;center&quot;, or &quot;right&quot; respectively.
</P>
<P>

The visibility information can either be a single value or a pair of
values in case of varying conditions. If there is only a single value,
then <CODE>meter</CODE> and <CODE>ft</CODE> holds the visibility, an optional
<CODE>prefix</CODE> can be `<SAMP>-1</SAMP>' if range is less than the lowest
reportable value or `<SAMP>1</SAMP>' if greater than the greatest reportable
value. A <CODE>tendency</CODE> entry holds either `<SAMP>D</SAMP>', `<SAMP>N</SAMP>' or
`<SAMP>U</SAMP>' for &quot;downward tendency&quot;, &quot;no distinct tendency&quot;, or
&quot;upward tendency&quot; respectively.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>weather</CODE>
<DD>This holds the current weather phenomena and is one of the most
interesting groups. It is an array of weather groups which means that
the the first group will be <CODE>$data['weather'][0]</CODE>, the second
group (if there is such a group) will be <CODE>$data['weather'][1]</CODE>,
and so on.
<P>

Each group contains a <CODE>proximity</CODE> entry which can be either
`<SAMP>VC</SAMP>' for phenomena in the vicinity or the empty string otherwise.
</P>
<P>

Next comes the <CODE>intensity</CODE>. This can be `<SAMP>-</SAMP>' for light
phenomena, the empty string for moderate phenomena, or `<SAMP>+</SAMP>' for
heavy phenomena.
</P>
<P>

This is followed by a <CODE>descriptor</CODE>, a <CODE>precipitation</CODE>, a
<CODE>obscuration</CODE>, and finally a <CODE>other</CODE> entry. These entries
contain the actual data found in the METAR. This means that it's up to
the application to decode these symbols further, so that `<SAMP>RA</SAMP>'
becomes &quot;rain&quot; and so on.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>clouds</CODE>
<DD>This is an array of cloud groups. Each group has a <CODE>condition</CODE>
entry which can be either `<SAMP>CAVOK</SAMP>' for no clouds and no
significant weather, `<SAMP>VV</SAMP>' for &quot;vertical visibility&quot;, `<SAMP>FEW</SAMP>'
for &quot;few clouds&quot;, `<SAMP>SCT</SAMP>' for &quot;scattered clouds&quot;, `<SAMP>BKN</SAMP>'
for &quot;broken clouds&quot;, `<SAMP>OVC</SAMP>' for &quot;overcast&quot;, and `<SAMP>SKC</SAMP>' and
`<SAMP>CLR</SAMP>' for &quot;clear sky&quot;. The condition `<SAMP>CAVOK</SAMP>' is a bit
special, because if it is present, then the <CODE>condition</CODE> entry
will be the only entry in the cloud group.
<P>

The other conditions will be part of a larger array with an optional
<CODE>cumulus</CODE> entry denoting the presence of cumulonimbus (`<SAMP>CB</SAMP>')
or towering cumulus (`<SAMP>TCU</SAMP>') clouds. There will also be
<CODE>meter</CODE> and <CODE>ft</CODE> entries with the height of the clouds. If
the clouds are below the station, then the height will be stored as
`<SAMP>nil</SAMP>'. Theres an optional <CODE>prefix</CODE> with the usual meaning.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>temperature</CODE>
<DD>This is the temperature group. It is an array with two or four
entries: <CODE>temp_c</CODE> and <CODE>temp_f</CODE> is always present and is the
temperature in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit respectively. If
information about the dew-point is present, then <CODE>dew_c</CODE> and
<CODE>dew_f</CODE> will be added to the array.
  
<DT><CODE>temp_min_max</CODE>
<DD>Some stations report the minimum and maximum temperature over various
timescales. The temperatures are stored in <CODE>min6h_c</CODE>,
<CODE>min6h_f</CODE>, <CODE>max6h_c</CODE> and <CODE>max6h_f</CODE> for the temperatures
in the last 6 hours, and in <CODE>min24h_c</CODE>, <CODE>min24h_f</CODE>,
<CODE>max24h_c</CODE> and <CODE>max24h_f</CODE> for the temperatures in the last
24 hours.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>altimeter</CODE>
<DD>This is the air pressure measured in various units. The array has
these entries: <CODE>inhg</CODE>, <CODE>mmhg</CODE>, <CODE>hpa</CODE>, and <CODE>atm</CODE>.
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>precipitation</CODE>
<DD>This is an array which stores the precipitation measured over various
timescales. The entries <CODE>mm</CODE> and <CODE>in</CODE> contains the
precipitation during the last hour, entries <CODE>mm_h6</CODE> and
<CODE>in_6h</CODE> store the amount of precipitation in the last 3--6 hours
and finally there is <CODE>mm_24h</CODE> and <CODE>in_24h</CODE> with the
precipitation measured over the last 24 hours. If there has been
snowfall, then that will be reported in the <CODE>snow_mm</CODE> and
<CODE>snow_in</CODE> entries.
<P>

All the entries can contain the special value `<SAMP>-1</SAMP>' which means
that there was only a trace of precipitation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DT><CODE>remarks</CODE>
<DD>Anything which is not recognized is added to this entry.

<H1> 5. Things To Do </H1>
<!--docid::SEC14::-->
<P>

PHP Weather is a work in progress -- it will probably never be
finished because people seams to have a never-ending thirst for new
features.
</P>
<P>

This an attempt to list some of the things that PHP Weather might do
in the future:
</P>
<P>

<UL>

<LI>
Parse Terminal Aearodome Forecasts (TAF) reports. These
reports are similar to METAR reports, the difference is that they
contain <EM>forecasts</EM> instead of just the current weather. This is
of course much more interesting that the current weather conditions.
<P>

There is more information about how to decode TAF reports at this
website: <A HREF="http://www.awc-kc.noaa.gov/awc/help/taf-decode.html">http://www.awc-kc.noaa.gov/awc/help/taf-decode.html</A>.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Improve the system used to select units. It would be nice, if the user
could choose a unit for each element displayed instead of just having
to choose between metric and imperial units.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Add support for other timezones than UTC so that people can say that
they want the time reported in their local timezone.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Have PHP Weather calculate the time of sunset and -rize automatically
based on latitude and longitude data for the stations.  This
information would be used to select correct sun/moon images.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
It should be possible to calculate the local time for a given station
based on the same geographical data combined with data about local
daylight saving times.
<P>

</UL>

<H1> 6. History </H1>
<!--docid::SEC15::-->
<P>

I began writing PHP Weather in June 2000. I had been talking with
Kristian Kristensen <A HREF="mailto:zianet@zianet.dk">zianet@zianet.dk</A> about making such a
script for a project we were both working on. But it was only after
the project was finished, that I began investigating the possibilities
of making a script with PHP that could display the current weather.
</P>
<P>

I knew that it was possible to do such a thing, as I had seen a couple
of applets (small programs that serves only one purpose, such as
displaying the time or the amount of free space on the hard drive,
etc.) that could display the weather. I discovered that they got their
data from the NWS who makes the data available at no cost.
</P>
<P>

The data is available off the Internet via either FTP or HTTP, so it
is easy to get hold of it with PHP. The only problem was that the data
has to be decoded because it is written in a compact fashion. The data
in question is a so-called METAR report that the airports issue once
or twice an hour.
</P>
<P>

I then discovered a script written in Perl that could take a METAR and
split it into its components. The script was written by Jeremy
D. Zawodny <A HREF="mailto:Jeremy@Zawodny.com">Jeremy@Zawodny.com</A> and is licensed under the GPL
just like PHP Weather. So there was no problem with me peeping at his
code for PHP Weather. I took the logic from the Perl script and wrote
a function in PHP that would decode a METAR.
</P>
<P>

But that would not do it -- to be useful the decoded data has to be
displayed in a nice fashion, preferable so that it is easy to
customize. The script should also be able to fetch a METAR from the
NWS and once that is done, the METAR should be cached so that the
script would run faster after the METAR had been fetched once. The
problem is, that it takes about a second to contact the NWS.
</P>
<P>

I wanted to see the data I could extract from the METAR in a
meaningfull way, so I started wrapping the data in English words to
form sentences like in &quot;The temperature is 20 degrees Celsius (68
degrees Fahrenheit)&quot;. That turned out very nice so I released the
code to the public.
</P>
<P>

I did not think about internationalization then, but after a while, I
received a Spanish translation made by Eduardo Guilenea.  Because the
script was not ready for internationalization, he had simply gone
through the script and translated all the English words into Spanish.
</P>
<P>

That promped me to start thinking about how we could translate PHP
Weater into other languages. I quickly found out, that it would work
if we kept the strings used in external files instead of having them
in the main `<TT>phpweather.inc</TT>' file. The users could then simply
use <CODE>include(locale_da.inc)</CODE> to get Danish output.
</P>
<P>

As things started to grow, it became apparent that PHP Weather would
have to be reorganized. I wanted a more flexible structure, a
structure that would allow us to extend PHP Weather in the future
without having to mess with the code that does the actually parsing of
the METARs. We also had to be able to support databases in a
cleaner way -- the code in `<TT>phpweather.inc</TT>' had turned into a
mess.
</P>
<P>

So I started to split the file up into several files, and also started
to use classes in PHP. This was the first time I had to do an object
oriented design, so it was very exciting.
</P>
<P>

The result is the current PHP Weather, and it does have a quite
flexible structure. All locale-specific code has been moved out from
the main parsing algorithms, so that PHP Weather can be truly
localized. All access to the database is now done through a database
abstraction layer: each database is defined in its own class, so it is
free to implement the various methods any way it wants.
</P>

<DT>Jeremy D. Zawodny
<DD><P>

He wrote <CODE>Geo::METAR</CODE>, which is a Perl module which can do some
of the things PHP Weather now does. <CODE>Geo::METAR</CODE> can be found
here: <A HREF="http://www.wcnet.org/jzawodn/perl/Geo-METAR/index.html">http://www.wcnet.org/jzawodn/perl/Geo-METAR/index.html</A>.

For suggesting that I use http to get the METARs instead of the much
slower ftp.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DT>Stefan Wiesendanger
<DD><P>

For rewritting some large <CODE>case</CODE>- and <CODE>switch</CODE>-statements as
a couple of arrays. This speeds-up the parsing of the METARs.
</P>
<P>

</P>

He noticed that the pressures was all wrong. I though the unit used in
the METAR was hPa, when it really was inHg.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<DT>Jeffrey Y. Sue
<DD><P>

Suggested that I told people how to turn off the warnings, if you
don't establish a connection to MySQL.
</P>
<P>

Later he made it possible to use PHP Weather with DBM databases. He
also added support for precipitation. Lots of other stuff, see the
`<TT>ChangeLog</TT>' for more details.

the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</P>
<P>

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</P>
<P>

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,

want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original

<P>

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free

refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
<P>

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
<P>

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</OL>
<P>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</P>
<P>

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</P>
<P>

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</OL>
<P>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</P>
<P>

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<P>

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
</P>
<P>

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</P>
<P>

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
<P>

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<P>

<center>
 NO WARRANTY
</center>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<H3> A.1.1 Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs </H3>
<!--docid::SEC20::-->
<P>

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
</P>
<P>

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
</P>
<P>

but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

</FONT></pre></td></tr></table><P>

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
</P>
<P>

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

The hypothetical commands `<SAMP>show w</SAMP>' and `<SAMP>show c</SAMP>' should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `<SAMP>show w</SAMP>' and
`<SAMP>show c</SAMP>'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.
</P>
<P>

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

<LI>
PREAMBLE
<P>

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document <EM>free</EM> in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.
</P>
<P>

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</P>
<P>

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
<P>

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
</P>
<P>

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</P>
<P>

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</P>
<P>

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.
</P>
<P>

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.
</P>
<P>

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.
</P>
<P>

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can
be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML
for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</P>
<P>

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
VERBATIM COPYING
<P>

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</P>
<P>

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
COPYING IN QUANTITY
<P>

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</P>
<P>

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</P>
<P>

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.
</P>
<P>

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
MODIFICATIONS
<P>

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</P>
<P>

<OL>
<LI>
Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
<P>

</P>
<LI>
State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Include an unaltered copy of this License.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Preserve the section entitled &quot;History&quot;, and its title, and add to
it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
In any section entitled &quot;Acknowledgments&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;,
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgments
and/or dedications given therein.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Delete any section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.
<P>

</P>
<LI>
Do not retitle any existing section as &quot;Endorsements&quot;
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
</OL>
<P>

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</P>
<P>

You may add a section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</P>
<P>

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</P>
<P>

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
COMBINING DOCUMENTS
<P>

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.
</P>
<P>

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</P>
<P>

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled &quot;History&quot;
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
&quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections entitled &quot;Acknowledgments&quot;,
and any sections entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;.  You must delete all sections
entitled &quot;Endorsements.&quot;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
<P>

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</P>
<P>

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
<P>

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an &quot;aggregate&quot;, and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
</P>
<P>

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
TRANSLATION
<P>

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
TERMINATION
<P>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<LI>
FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
<P>

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</A>.
</P>
<P>

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

<H3> A.2.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents </H3>
<!--docid::SEC22::-->
<P>

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</P>
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><pre><FONT SIZE=-1>  Copyright (C)  <VAR>year</VAR>  <VAR>your name</VAR>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with the Invariant Sections being <VAR>list their titles</VAR>, with the
  Front-Cover Texts being <VAR>list</VAR>, and with the Back-Cover Texts being <VAR>list</VAR>.
  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table><P>

If you have no Invariant Sections, write &quot;with no Invariant Sections&quot;
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write &quot;no Front-Cover Texts&quot; instead of
&quot;Front-Cover Texts being <VAR>list</VAR>&quot;; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
</P>
<P>

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
