The *Comment* [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] lets you hide parts of a Wiki page without actually
deleting the text. Comments will only be visible in the Wiki markup
when editing or viewing the source.

== Usage

Simply place the text to be commented out between =<~?plugin Comment=
and =?~>=:

{{{
<?plugin Comment

== A Hidden Section

This text will not show up in the generated HTML page, but it is still
visible when editing the WikiMarkup.

?>
}}}

== Author

<?plugin Comment

== "Fuzzy" Logic
Theorem: a cat has nine tails.
Proof:
    No cat has eight tails. A cat has one tail more than no cat.
    Therefore, a cat has nine tails.
