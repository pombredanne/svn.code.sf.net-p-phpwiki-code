== Adding pages ==

To add a new page to the wiki, all you have to do is come up with a
meaningful title and put it between {{{[[double brackets]]}}}.

Then you can go ahead and click the question mark at the end of your new
hyperlink, and the Wiki will give you a window for making the new page.

The page name can contain any character, except:
* angle brackets (<>),
* square brackets ([]),
* curly brackets ({}),
* double quotes ("),
* pipe (|),
* and hash sign (#) that is used for anchors.

If you wish to add documents with complex markup to the wiki, you
might be better off providing a URL to it than trying to add the text
of the document here, like so:
{{{
[[http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/|PhpWiki project homepage]]
}}}
[[http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/|PhpWiki project homepage]]

The Wiki does not support most HTML tags, only the simplest. See [[Help:TextFormattingRules|TextFormattingRules]].
<tags>They will just render like text.</tags> Wiki is meant to be as
simple as possible to encourage use.

Note that there is a feature that your system administrator can enable
to allow [[Help:RawHtmlPlugin|embedded HTML]], but there are security risks involved.

== Removing pages ==

[[PhpWikiAdministration/Remove|Removing a page]] will clear all it versions.
The history of the page will still be visible and the removal will appear in the [[RecentChanges]].
It will be possible to restore the page by creating a new version; in that case, all previous versions will be restored.

You must be logged as administrator to be able to remove a page.

== Purging pages ==

[[PhpWikiAdministration/Purge|Purging a page]] will delete it with all its versions without any possibility to restore it.
Purging will not appear in the [[RecentChanges]].

You must be logged as administrator to be able to purge a page.
