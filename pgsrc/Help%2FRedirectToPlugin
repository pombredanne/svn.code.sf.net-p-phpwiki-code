The *~RedirectTo* [plugin|Help:WikiPlugin] can be used to redirect a user to another page.
In other words it makes a page an _alias_ for another page.

!!! Arguments

Use only one of these arguments at a time.

page |
  The page to redirect to (a wiki page name).
href |
  An external URL to redirect to.  Redirection to external URLs will only work
  on locked pages.  (If the URL contains funny characters, you'll probably have
  to put quotes around the URL.)

!! Caveats

The ~RedirectToPlugin invocation must be the first thing on a page.
For most purposes it makes any other content on the page inaccessible.

!!! Example

A page may be made a alias for the HomePage by placing this code at the top:
<verbatim>
<?plugin RedirectTo page="HomePage" ?>
</verbatim>

To see the example in action, visit HomePageAlias.
