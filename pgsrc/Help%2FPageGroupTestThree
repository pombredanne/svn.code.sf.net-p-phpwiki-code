<?plugin PageGroup
         label="Go!"
         parent=Help:PageGroupTest
         section="Table of Contents"
?>

Note that the navigation bar can be anywhere, it doesn't have to be at
the bottom or even consistent from page to page. The label can also
vary--not sure if this is a good thing. Click Next.
