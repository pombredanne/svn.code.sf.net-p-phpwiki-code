The contents of all pages are searched to find links to the current
page. The BackLinks function also answers the question: "Which pages
contain the title of this page?".

----

<?plugin BackLinks exclude||='' include_self||=1 noheader||=0 ?>

----

To display the list of pages which all contain multiple links use a pagelist as page argument.
For example <tt><~?~plugin BackLinks page=Milk,Honey ?~></tt> would display all pages which 
contain links to Milk AND Honey.
