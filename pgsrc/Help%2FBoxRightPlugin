The *~BoxRight* [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] displays its content as a wiki-formatted
right-floating div box with border.

If ENABLE_MARKUP_DIVSPAN is enabled then you can produce the same result with a simple =~<div~>=:

~<~div class=boxright~> <br>
<strong>Example text</strong>
([What is a Wiki?|Help:WikiWikiWeb])
~</div~>

<div class=boxright>
<strong>Example text</strong>
([What is a Wiki?|Help:WikiWikiWeb])
</div>
