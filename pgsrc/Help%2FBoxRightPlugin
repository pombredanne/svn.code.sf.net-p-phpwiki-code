The [BoxRight|Help:BoxRightPlugin] plugin displays its content as a wiki-formatted
right-floating div box with border.
Since v1.3.13.

If ENABLE_MARKUP_DIVSPAN is enabled then you can produce the same result with a simple =~<div~>=:

~<~div class=boxright~> <br>
<strong>Example text</strong>
([What is a Wiki?|WikiWikiWeb])
~</div~>

<div class=boxright>
<strong>Example text</strong>
([What is a Wiki?|WikiWikiWeb])
</div>

!!! Typical Usage

<verbatim>
<?plugin BoxRight
<strong>This Wiki</strong> ([What is a Wiki?|WikiWikiWeb]) is a place where problems and
solutions are being documented.

See [How to use this Wiki|Help/HowToUseWiki] for instructions.

<em>Don't be afraid - it's easy and you can't break anything!</em>
