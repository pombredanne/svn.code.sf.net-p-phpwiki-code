The **~UpLoad** [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] displays an editbox and two buttons. 
The first button let's you choose the file to be uploaded at your local filesystem. 
The textvalue of this button is localised from your browser. 
The second "Upload" button actually uploads the given filename to the upload directory.
This directory is not browsable, any file there may be accessed by using the "Upload~:" 
InterWikiMap prefix to the given filename. This way you can easily inline uploaded images.
See PhpWiki:InlineUploadedImages
