The **~BackLinks** [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] lists all pages which link to a given page.

The contents of all pages are searched to find links to the current
page. The ~BackLinks function also answers the question: “Which pages
contain the title of this page?”.

To display the list of pages which all contain multiple links use a pagelist as page argument.
For example {{{<<BackLinks page=Milk,Honey>>}}} would display all pages which
contain links to Milk AND Honey.

== Usage ==

{{{
<<BackLinks arguments>>
}}}

== Arguments ==

All [[Help:PageList|PageList]] arguments, plus the following ones:

{| class="bordered"
|-

| Boolean. If true, do not display header.
| false
|-
| **linkmore**

== Example ==

{{{

Back links will not be found if the link is inside a table, or in an included template,
or in general if the link is in text generated by a plugin.
